Hello!

I am currently the Bingham Postdoctoral Teacher-Scholar at Transylvania University, where I do a mixture of program development and assessment, teaching, and university-wide trainings and workshops for the Data Science Program. My research focuses on using mixed-methods to study how stigmatization affects the health and group consciousness of LGBTQ+ people, with a particular focus on  This includes research using psychometrics, experimental design, Bayesian model averaging, machine learning, and qualitative data collection and analysis methods.

My dissertation specifically investigates LGBTQ people's sense of linked fate as a way to broaden our understanding of this concept and expand its theoretical framework. I use a combination of survey, phenomenological, and psychometric techniques to explore (1) how LGBTQ people experience a sense of linked fate, (2) the experiential and affective mechanisms driving LGBTQ people's sense of linked fate, and (3) develop a novel, multidimensional measure to assess LGBTQ people's sense of linked fate.

Beyond my dissertation, my research agenda is broad. My current research agenda includes investigating how distal and proximal stressors shape heterogeneity in LGBTQ people's sense of linked fate, experimental designs to investigate the differential activation of linked fate, and utilizing Bayesian ensembling methods and Super Learners to investigate the link between political elites and constituent identity.
