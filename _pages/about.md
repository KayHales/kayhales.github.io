Hello!

I am currently the Bingham Postdoctoral Teacher-Scholar at Transylvania University, where I do a mixture of program development and assessment, teaching, and university-wide trainings and workshops for the Data Science Program. My research focuses on using mixed-methods to study how stigmatization affects the health and group consciousness of LGBTQ+ people, with a particular focus on  This includes research using psychometrics, experimental design, Bayesian model averaging, machine learning, and qualitative data collection and analysis methods.

My research agenda is broad. My current research agenda includes investigating how distal and proximal stressors shape heterogeneity in LGBTQ people's sense of linked fate, experimental designs to investigate the differential activation of linked fate, and utilizing Bayesian ensembling methods and Super Learners to investigate the link between political elites and constituent identity. My current projects with students involve using quantitative methods to explore the affects of SCOTUS gift receiving, machine learning algorithm bias in gender detection, and the political + psychological drivers of queer identification. 

Beyond my research, teaching is what really drives my passion and interest as an academic. I have taught a variety of both substantive and methodogological courses across in-person, online synchronous, and online ayschonronous modalities. In addition to the courses I have individually taught, I have taught a variety of workshops on topics ranging from using Python and R for legal/judicial research, causal inference using R for econometrics, baseball analytics, and epidemiological research methods using R and Python. I am committed to and fully believe in teaching students the importance of quantitative methods and data science along with their substantive learning.
